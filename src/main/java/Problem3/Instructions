Calculator problems
For each problem, create a console application or a web page that works as a calculator. The calculator
accepts keyboard input from a user (a mathematical expression) and presents the result (a number).
No fancier type of user interface is required.
The calculator must handle expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Present a separate solution for each calculator problem.
If your programming language of choice has evaluation of mathematical expressions built into it (like Python
and Javascript does), don't use that. We want to see you write some code.


Problem 3: one operator, two parameters
The calculator handles exactly one operator and two numerical parameters.
