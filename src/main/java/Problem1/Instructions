Problem 1: Detect Anagram
Write a function to check if two provided strings are anagrams of each other.
Your function should return true if two strings are anagram, false otherwise.
Two strings are anagrams if they are the same length and contain the same characters but in a different
order. For example, "army" and "Mary" are anagrams.
You should ignore cases for this problem.
Show that the function works as intended with unit tests.
