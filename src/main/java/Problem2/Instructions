Problem 2: Find all links on a web page
Write an application that accepts a URL (like http://google.com) as input that scans that web page for all
existing web-links (<a> HTML tags) and prints them to the console or presents them on a web page.
Use Selenium WebDriver for navigating to and reading the DOM of the web page
